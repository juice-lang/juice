# Contributing to *juice*

Thanks for your interest in the *juiciest* programming language on earth! :+1::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Because there is no code yet, there is nothing much to do just now.  
There are a few things though:

If you are a native english speaker, you could review the [docs](https://juice-lang.github.io). You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/juice-lang/juice-lang.github.io). If you see any spelling mistakes or phrases, which could be better, please fix them and create a pull request. Of course you can also correct mistakes in the README‘s of my repos or also in this file. :wink:

Create an issue at this repository, if you have an idea, which could improve the language and is not mentioned in the [documentation](https://juice-lang.github.io).

---

That‘s all for now, there will be more options for contribution, as soon as I start pushing code to GitHub.
